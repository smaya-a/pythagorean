# Introduction

Word count: 250–450 words

This is the first written element of an edition: the first content readers encounter.

The purpose of this introduction is to set the scene: to provide an initial description of the source as well as an overview your edition, highlighting its features and supplements. This is not a space for much detail about the source or our editorial work with it. Later sections will allow you to do that. Here, your job is to help readers understand that they are looking at a digital edition of a historical source and why that source is interesting.

The premium is on precise, no-nonsense prose.

At bottom, you should include:

**How to Cite:**
Here, provide a citation using this model:

> Lastname, Firstname, FirstName LastName, and FirstName, Lastname. “Title of Web Page.” Name of Website (if different from web page). Publication or Revision Date. URL.

Your teams have multiple authors.  In scholarship, if authorship is equal across all team members, then the custom is to list by last name them in alphabetical order.  If you wish to deviate from this order you can but that will communicate priority (i.e. that the one who goes first is the 'lead author', etc.).

If you choose and wish to do so, you may also include a Creative Commons license here. We'll discuss those in class.

Here and throughout your edition, you should use footnotes in Chicago Notes and Bibliography style.[^1]  Please note that if sources are listed in your bibliography (and all your main ones should be), you may use a shortened form in these notes (e.g. Smith, _Towards a Better Understanding_, 5, with the full citation to Smith going in the bibliography).

# The Source

Theano to Euboule

1. I hear that you are spoiling your children. The task of a good mother, 
however, is not to endeavor to please her children, but instead to train them in self-restraint. Beware that you don’t act like an indulgent mother ratherthan a loving one, because pleasure ingrained in children leads to a lack of discipline. For what indeed is more pleasing to the youngsters than an ingrained pleasure? You must, my dear, nurture your children without 
corrupting their nature. Nurture can corrupt children’s nature when their 
minds seek, and their bodies experience pleasures, and thus they become 
intellectually lazy and physically weak 10
2. We should train the children we raise to face fear – even if this means
they may have to grieve and suffer – so that they do not become slaves to
such emotions, eager for pleasures and intolerant of hardship, but instead
develop the utmost reverence for what is right, abstain from pleasures and
withstand hardships. You should not make them gluttonous for food,
spoiled with diverse pleasures, and wild through their unrestrained childish
games, or allow them to say and try everything they want, while you are
afraid when they cry, are proud when they laugh, laugh when they hit the
nurse or insult you, provide shade in the summer and heat in the winter, and
many other luxuries. Poor children know none of these (luxuries) and are
brought up more easily, grow up not the worse for it, and turn out much
stronger.
3. You, however, nurse your children like the progeny of Sardanapalus,
weakening the nature of your sons through luxurious living. What can
become of a child who cries if he does not eat soon enough; who, when he
eats, seeks pleasure in fancy food; who is exhausted when it is hot, shakes
and collapses when it is cold; who argues when someone criticizes him,
suffers when someone doesn’t satisfy his whims, is annoyed whenever he is
not chewing, wastes time on idle pleasures, and wanders around endlessly
mumbling to himself?
4. Therefore, my dear, knowing that spoiled children when they grow up
to be men, become slaves (scil. to passion), be careful to take away such
pleasures, by making their meals austere rather than luxurious, allowing
them to endure hunger and thirst, and even cold, heat, and shame before
their peers and superiors. For only in this way can they become noble in
spirit whether they are praised or reprimanded. For hardships, my friend,
are a sort of dye mordant to which children are exposed when their virtue is
perfected, and those who have been dipped long enough wear the hue of
virtue as something of their own. So, make sure, my dear, that because of
(your) indulgence, your children do not acquire the vices of insolence and
utter worthlessness, in the same way that poorly tended vines bear inferior
fruit.

10 Literally: “they become pleasure-seeking in their souls, pleasure-loving in their bodies, and their souls become lazies and their bodies too weak”
