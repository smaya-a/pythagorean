# Introduction

Word count: 250–450 words

This is the first written element of an edition: the first content readers encounter.

The purpose of this introduction is to set the scene: to provide an initial description of the source as well as an overview your edition, highlighting its features and supplements. This is not a space for much detail about the source or our editorial work with it. Later sections will allow you to do that. Here, your job is to help readers understand that they are looking at a digital edition of a historical source and why that source is interesting.

The premium is on precise, no-nonsense prose.

At bottom, you should include:

**How to Cite:**
Here, provide a citation using this model:

> Lastname, Firstname, FirstName LastName, and FirstName, Lastname. “Title of Web Page.” Name of Website (if different from web page). Publication or Revision Date. URL.

Your teams have multiple authors.  In scholarship, if authorship is equal across all team members, then the custom is to list by last name them in alphabetical order.  If you wish to deviate from this order you can but that will communicate priority (i.e. that the one who goes first is the 'lead author', etc.).

If you choose and wish to do so, you may also include a Creative Commons license here. We'll discuss those in class.

Here and throughout your edition, you should use footnotes in Chicago Notes and Bibliography style.[^1]  Please note that if sources are listed in your bibliography (and all your main ones should be), you may use a shortened form in these notes (e.g. Smith, _Towards a Better Understanding_, 5, with the full citation to Smith going in the bibliography).

# The Source

This section provides the main presentation of your source, as you have prepared it for readers (i.e., a facsimile, transcription, video, audio clip, etc.). This section is where we satisfy the first of the ADE’s three criteria for an electronic edition by providing a rigorous, accurate presentation of historical material.

For the presentation of some sources, it may make sense to break up the presentation into multiple pages. For that, as needed, we can use a more book like template (binding multiple pages together) that I can provide. Nonetheless, this page should be the page from which all presentations of the source itself start.

This may also be a space where editorial annotations are provided, such as notes on provenance, archival location, transcription, and more. If possible, a link to the source’s permanent digital location should be included here as well as a citation for that location. This should be done in consultation with the instructors, editorial board, and peer reviewers.

Please note: some presentations may benefit from a multipage format (rather than one scrolling page, as here). I can make a multipage template available to you as needed.

χὴ δέ ἐστιν οἴκου πρώτη γυναιξὶν ἀρχὴ θεραπαινῶν. ἔστι δέ,

2. Δικαία δὲ χρῆσις αἰτία τούτου, ἵνα μήτε διὰ τὸν κόπον

καθ’ ἣν γνώσῃ τὸ μὲν ἀληθὲς τῆς ἁμαρτίας πρὸς τὸ τῆς κα-

κατ’ ἀξίαν τῆς κολάσεως.
4. Δεσποτικαὶ δὲ καὶ συγγνώμη καὶ χάρις ἐφ’ ἡμαρτημένοις ζη-

διὰ ζῆλον ἢ θυμόν, οἷον ὑπομνηματογραφούμεναι τὴν ὑπερβο-

αἱ δὲ φυγῇ τὴν σωτηρίαν ἐπορίσαντο, τινὲς δὲ ἐπαύσαντο τοῦ

μόνωσις ὀδυρομένης τὴν οἰκείαν ἀβουλίαν ἔρημον μετάνοιαν
ἔχει.
5. Ἀλλ’, ὦ φίλη, ἴσθι μιμουμένη τὰ ὄργανα, ἃ <δια>φωνεῖ (40)
μᾶλλον ἀνειμένα, ἐκρήττεται δὲ μᾶλλον ἐπιτεινόμενα. καὶ
γὰρ ἐπὶ τῶν θεραπαινῶν ταὐτόν· ἡ μὲν ἄγαν ἄνεσις διαφωνί-
αν ἐμποιεῖ τῆς πειθαρχίας, ἡ δὲ ἐπίτασις τῆς ἀνάγκης διά-
λυσιν τῆς φύσεως. καὶ ἐπὶ τούτου δεῖ νοεῖν· μέτρον δ’
ἐπὶ πᾶσιν ἄριστον. [ἔρρωσο.]




[^14]: This sentence exceptionally follows Thesleff ’s text (198: 15–16). Städele eliminates χάρις and prints γνώμη rather than συγγνώμη: Δεσποτικὴ δὲ καὶ ἡ γνώμη [χάρις] ἐφ’ ἡμαρτημένοις ζημίας ἀπαλλάττουσα· (It is within the owner’s discretion to cancel punishment for transgressions.) These two concepts also appear in ThN and seem integral to the system of ethics presented in Theano’s letters.


## Theano to Callisto (English)



1. The right to manage household slaves is given by custom to you younger women as soon as you are married. Nonetheless, instruction by older women, who are always offering advice in everything that concerns domestic affairs, is necessary. It is proper first to recognize what you don’t know and to consider the advice of older women most suitable. In these things a young mind must be educated from girlhood. The first domestic responsibility for women is the management of slave women, and the most important aspect in dealing with slaves is, my dear, their good will. For this is not something purchased as (our) property along with their bodies, but intelligent owners create it afterwards.
2. And it is obtained through such fair treatment that they are neither
exhausted by overwork nor lose strength because of deprivation. They are human beings by nature. Some women consider what is least profitable as a profit: the mistreatment of slave women, burdening them with chores while decreasing their rations. Securing petty profits in this way, they pay huge penalties: ill will and treachery of the worst kind. You, however, will have a convenient measure for the rations of food: in proportion to the amount of wool produced by a day’s work.
3. This is all you need to do about their diet. As for lack of discipline, 
you must see to what suits you, not what is convenient for them. You should value slave-women according to their merit. Cruelty will not instill gratitude in their minds, while rational treatment assures discipline no less efficiently. If, however, it is impossible to suppress the excess of their malice, one must drive it out by means of selling them. Let the estranged slave, become (formally) estranged from the owner. [^15] In this, let it be your chief concern that you establish first the fact of the offence, with the aim of giving a just verdict, second the magnitude of the offense, with the aim of giving an appropriate punishment.
4. It is worthy of a woman who is in control to forgive and cancel punishment for transgressions; in doing so she shall uphold decency in a way that is true to her character. Some women, my dear, out of savagery actually whip the bodies of the slave women, and turn into beasts through jealousy or anger, as though carving (scil. into the slaves’ bodies) their extreme bitterness. Some servants have been killed through being worn out over time, others have sought salva-tion through escape, yet others died, having ended their lives with their own hands. Then at last the solitude of the mistress who bewails her own lack of judgment finally brings a change of mind—too late.
5. But you, my dear, mindfully imitate (the art of tuning) string instru-
ments, which are out of tune when excessively loose and snap when strung too tight. The same holds true for the slave women: excessive leniency produces dissonance of discipline; severity inevitably destroys their lives. Finally, one needs to keep in mind that “measure is best in all things.” [Farewell.]




[^15]: Literally: “Let what is foreign to the need (of the house) be estranged from its mistress.” This process of estrangement is the opposite of oikeiōsis.
