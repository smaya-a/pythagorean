# Introduction
 Within the study of ancient philosophy, the work of women is largely missing, with texts attributed to female authors being rare and largely inaccessible. Through the work of our digital edition, we hope to bring forward a sample of previously understudied texts and provide a window into perceptions of female philosophers.

This project is a collection of written fragments attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher Theano, a follower of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras. These fragments were not written by Theano herself; instead, they were written many centuries later, according to a Neopythagorean tradition of attempting to recreate earlier philosophical writing.  More specifically, this edition contains the English and Greek translations of 4 letters addressed to 4 different women: Euobole, Nicostrate, Calisto, and Timareta. Within the letters, Theano advises them on motherhood, marriage, and domestic duties respectively. 

Altogether, the following texts provide a new opportunity to examine and interact with these rich sources and the intellectual world of Ancient Greece.

## **Note on Text and Translations, from Dorota Dutsch**

"I have included only the texts of those treatises and letters attributed 
to women that I discuss; for a full list of titles and texts, see Table 3. The Greek 
text of the treatises below generally follows Thesleff’s edition (1965 = T), 
that of the letters and notes, Städele’s (1980 = S). The exceptions are 
identified in footnotes. The fragment of Theano to Timareta appears only 
in Thesleff. Pages in Thesleff and Städele, respectively, are given at the 
beginning of each text in bold and indicated in parentheses in the text. 
The division of the fragments of treatises into sections is mine; that of the 
letters follows Städele... All translations are mine."

## Note on Theano to Callisto

In this letter to Callisto, Theano instructs Callisto on how to manage household slaves. She recommends treating them fairly, being neither too strict nor too lenient. Interestingly, Theano advises the woman to seek advice from older married women. In Ancient Greece, women would commonly marry very young, sometimes as young as 14, and would immediately be thrust into responsibilities that they were ill-prepared to undertake. While a wife would often learn these duties from her husband, Theano posits that women must instead look to other women for this ethical education.

[^14]: This sentence exceptionally follows Thesleff ’s text (198: 15–16). Städele eliminates χάρις and prints γνώμη rather than συγγνώμη: Δεσποτικὴ δὲ καὶ ἡ γνώμη [χάρις] ἐφ’ ἡμαρτημένοις ζημίας ἀπαλλάττουσα· (It is within the owner’s discretion to cancel punishment for transgressions.) These two concepts also appear in ThN and seem integral to the system of ethics presented in Theano’s letters. -DD


## Theano to Callisto (English)



1. The right to manage household slaves is given by custom to you younger women as soon as you are married. Nonetheless, instruction by older women, who are always offering advice in everything that concerns domestic affairs, is necessary. It is proper first to recognize what you don’t know and to consider the advice of older women most suitable. In these things a young mind must be educated from girlhood. The first domestic responsibility for women is the management of slave women, and the most important aspect in dealing with slaves is, my dear, their good will. For this is not something purchased as (our) property along with their bodies, but intelligent owners create it afterwards.
2. And it is obtained through such fair treatment that they are neither
exhausted by overwork nor lose strength because of deprivation. They are human beings by nature. Some women consider what is least profitable as a profit: the mistreatment of slave women, burdening them with chores while decreasing their rations. Securing petty profits in this way, they pay huge penalties: ill will and treachery of the worst kind. You, however, will have a convenient measure for the rations of food: in proportion to the amount of wool produced by a day’s work.
3. This is all you need to do about their diet. As for lack of discipline, 
you must see to what suits you, not what is convenient for them. You should value slave-women according to their merit. Cruelty will not instill gratitude in their minds, while rational treatment assures discipline no less efficiently. If, however, it is impossible to suppress the excess of their malice, one must drive it out by means of selling them. Let the estranged slave, become (formally) estranged from the owner. [^15] In this, let it be your chief concern that you establish first the fact of the offence, with the aim of giving a just verdict, second the magnitude of the offense, with the aim of giving an appropriate punishment.
4. It is worthy of a woman who is in control to forgive and cancel punishment for transgressions; in doing so she shall uphold decency in a way that is true to her character. Some women, my dear, out of savagery actually whip the bodies of the slave women, and turn into beasts through jealousy or anger, as though carving (scil. into the slaves’ bodies) their extreme bitterness. Some servants have been killed through being worn out over time, others have sought salva-tion through escape, yet others died, having ended their lives with their own hands. Then at last the solitude of the mistress who bewails her own lack of judgment finally brings a change of mind—too late.
5. But you, my dear, mindfully imitate (the art of tuning) string instru-
ments, which are out of tune when excessively loose and snap when strung too tight. The same holds true for the slave women: excessive leniency produces dissonance of discipline; severity inevitably destroys their lives. Finally, one needs to keep in mind that “measure is best in all things.” [Farewell.]




[^15]: Literally: “Let what is foreign to the need (of the house) be estranged from its mistress.” This process of estrangement is the opposite of oikeiōsis. -DD

## Theano to Timareta (Fr.) (Greek)


T 200 No. 7; Poll. Onom. 10.21.5–9. . τὸν οἰκοδεσπότην καὶ τὴν
οἰκοδέσποιναν . . . ταῦτα ἄμφω εὗρον ἐν Θεανοῦς τῆς Πυθαγόρου γυναικὸς
ἐπιστολῇ πρὸς Τιμαρέταν γραφείσῃ. ὁ δὲ οἰκοδεσπότης ἔστι κα
Ἀλέξιδος ἐν Ταραντίνοις. . .

## Theano to Timareta (Fr.)(English)


οἰκοδεσπότης “the master of the house” and οἰκοδέσποινα “the mistress of
the house” I found both compound nouns in the letter that Theano the wife
of Pythagoras has written for Timareta; οἰκοδεσπότης is also used in Alexis’
The People of Tarentum.



# About this Source

The four letters included in this edition belong to a body of writings known as the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha, produced during the first and second centuries CE. Although these texts claim authorship by figures associated with the early Pythagorean community of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, none of them is genuinely archaic. Instead, they were created several centuries after Pythagoras lived, in a cultural moment when interest in the Pythagorean past was being revived. These letters are part of a larger effort by later authors to construct a coherent tradition that stretched back to Pythagoras and his followers, despite the absence of any authenticated writings from the historical founder himself.

Pythagoras is unusual among major philosophical figures as he left no written texts. His teachings were transmitted orally, and later generations encountered only indirect references to what he believed or taught. This absence created an intellectual vacuum. By the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Pythagoras had acquired an almost legendary reputation, and authors began to fill in the gaps by producing letters, treatises, and sayings attributed to him and those around him. These writings were not intended as outright forgeries in a modern sense. Rather, they functioned as imaginative reconstructions, attempts to give shape to a philosophical lineage that had become central to later thinkers.

The letters attributed to Theano fit exactly within this context. Theano appears in later biographical traditions as either the wife or student of Pythagoras, although there is no contemporary evidence for her existence. By the Roman period, she had become an idealized figure associated with the domestic and ethical dimension of Pythagoreanism. Attaching new writings to her name provided a way for authors to explore topics related to women’s conduct, household authority, and moral education while grounding those ideas in a supposedly ancient foundation. These texts therefore reveal as much about the period in which they were composed as about the past they claimed to represent.

The presence of women in the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha is striking, given the broader context of ancient Greek intellectual life. Classical Greek philosophy was overwhelmingly male, and women were generally excluded from institutions of learning and public discourse. Their lives were shaped by expectations of modesty, obedience, and domestic management. Yet the Neopythagorean corpus includes multiple female figures such as Theano, Damo, Myia, and Melissa, who appear as confident moral authorities. Their writings address household management, childrearing, and ethical behavior, all framed as philosophical duties. The content of the letters also reveals the way Neopythagorean writers conceived of philosophical authority. Rather than focusing on abstract metaphysics or mathematics, the letters explore how to live a proper life. They treat quotidian actions (speech, dress, childrearing, etc.) as morally significant, which reflects a broader Pythagorean interest in shaping the soul through disciplined habit. While these texts do not prove that women actively participated in philosophical circles, they do show that later authors imagined a Pythagorean tradition in which female instruction was plausible, even desirable.

This imagined past worked to legitimize contemporary social roles. Roman imperial culture valued household order as the foundation of civic stability, and the Pythagorean letters reflect this emphasis. Theano’s advice frequently links personal virtue to household management, implying that ethical behavior begins in the private sphere. By situating such claims in the voice of an ancient woman philosopher, the texts embed Roman ideals about domestic authority in a tradition represented as timeless. The strategy is effective: readers are encouraged to treat these moral directives as inherited wisdom rather than recent invention.

The pseudonymous format was crucial to this projection. By attributing their writings to figures like Theano, later authors created the illusion of continuity with the ancient past. Modern scholarship has shown that many of these letters were written by educated men during the Roman imperial period, not by women. However, their authors’ decision to write in the voices of women gives us insight into how gender was conceptualized within later philosophical contexts. Women in these texts are depicted as moral authorities within the household, and their authority derives from virtues such as moderation, self-control, and protectiveness over the family unit. The Pythagorean letters thus perform a cultural function: they offer models of behavior that align domestic hierarchy with philosophical legitimacy.

There is also a wider cultural reason for the choice of the letter form. Letters were a common vehicle for philosophical instruction during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Philosophers such as Epicurus and Seneca used letters to convey ethical teaching in a concise and personal way. The letter format allowed Pythagorean writers to present advice as though it were directed to real addressees, reinforcing the impression of authenticity. The practical tone of these letters contrasts with the more speculative style of other ancient philosophical genres, making them appear accessible and direct.

It is important to recognize that the inclusion of women in these texts does not necessarily reflect real opportunities for female philosophical agency. The letters depict women acting within boundaries that male authors considered appropriate. They are authoritative only insofar as they reinforce domestic order. The texts do not present women debating metaphysics or participating in politics. Rather, they situate women as stewards of household virtue, responsible for maintaining social stability. This limited scope suggests that although women could be imagined within the philosophical tradition, their imagined roles remained constrained by the assumptions of their time.

Nonetheless, the letters should not be dismissed as strictly reflecting tradition. They complicate our understanding of ancient intellectual history by showing that women were not entirely absent from philosophical narratives. Even if their voices were constructed, the fact that writers felt compelled to include them indicates a shift in how philosophical authority was conceived. The Pythagorean tradition, real or invented, provided a space in which women could appear as philosophical agents, however narrowly defined. The resulting texts offer a rare window onto ancient beliefs about gender, ethics, and authorship, and reveal how cultural memory can reshape the past to serve present needs.

# About this Edition

The four letters in this edition are Neopythagorean pseudepigrapha: later compositions presented as advice from Theano, a figure whom later sources describe as a Pythagorean philosopher associated with ethical and domestic instruction. Although the letters claim an earlier origin, they were written in the first or second century CE and reflect how later authors imagined Theano’s voice rather than preserving the words of a historical individual.

The Greek and English texts used here were provided by Professor Dorota Dutsch, whose translations we reproduce without alteration. Dutsch based her work on the standard modern editions of the Pythagorean letters, using William Thesleff’s The Pythagorean Texts of the Hellenistic Period (1965) and Adolf Städele’s The Letters of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans (1980). Both scholars relied on fragments preserved in a fifth-century CE anthology compiled by Johannes of Stobi, who assembled excerpts of philosophical writings for his son. 

In her own approach, Dutsch focuses on presenting the material in a format that reflects how these texts operated within the Pythagorean tradition rather than attempting to reconstruct an earlier version. She selects only the works attributed to women that she examines in her research and generally follows Thesleff for treatises and Städele for letters, retaining Städele’s section divisions and adding her own only when needed for clarity. Her aim is to preserve the character of the surviving texts while making their structure and purpose accessible to modern readers. All translations are her own. We have kept her footnotes, marking them with a "-DD" to distinguish them from ours.
