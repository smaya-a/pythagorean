# Introduction
Within the study of ancient philosophy, the work of women is largely missing, with texts attributed to female authors being rare and largely inaccessible. Through the work of our digital edition, we hope to bring forward a sample of previously understudied texts and provide a window into perceptions of female philosophers.

This project is a collection of written fragments attributed to the Pythagorist philosopher Theano, a follower of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras. These fragments were not written by Theano herself; instead they were written many centuries later, according to a Neopythagorean tradition of attempting to recreate earlier philosophical writing. More specifically, this edition contains the English and Greek translations of 4 letters addressed to 4 different women: Euobole, Nicostrate, Calisto, and Timareta. Within the letters, Theano advises them on motherhood, marriage, and domestic duties respectively. 

The Greek and English texts used within this edition were translated by Dorota Dutsch and transcribed by our group. Dutsch’s work is based on the standard modern editions of the letters using William Thesleff’s “The Pythagorean Texts of the Hellenistic Period” (1965) and Adolf Städele’s “The Letters of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans” (1980). 

Altogether, the following letters provide a new opportunity to examine and interact with these rich sources and the intellectual world of Ancient Greece.

## **Note on Text and Translations, from Dorota Dutsch**

"I have included only the texts of those treatises and letters attributed  
to women that I discuss; for a full list of titles and texts, see Table 3. The Greek   
text of the treatises below generally follows Thesleff’s edition (1965 = T),   
that of the letters and notes, Städele’s (1980 = S). The exceptions are   
identified in footnotes. The fragment of Theano to Timareta appears only   
in Thesleff. Pages in Thesleff and Städele, respectively, are given at the   
beginning of each text in bold and indicated in parentheses in the text.   
The division of the fragments of treatises into sections is mine; that of the   
letters follows Städele... All translations are mine."

1. I hear that you are spoiling your children. The task of a good mother,   
however, is not to endeavor to please her children, but instead to train them   
in self-restraint. Beware that you don’t act like an indulgent mother rather  
than a loving one, because pleasure ingrained in children leads to a lack of   
discipline. For what indeed is more pleasing to the youngsters than an   
ingrained pleasure? You must, my dear, nurture your children without   
corrupting their nature. Nurture can corrupt children’s nature when their   
minds seek, and their bodies experience pleasures, and thus they become   
intellectually lazy and physically weak. [^19]  
2. We should train the children we raise to face fear – even if this means  
they may have to grieve and suffer – so that they do not become slaves to  
such emotions, eager for pleasures and intolerant of hardship, but instead  
develop the utmost reverence for what is right, abstain from pleasures and  
withstand hardships. You should not make them gluttonous for food,  
spoiled with diverse pleasures, and wild through their unrestrained childish  
games, or allow them to say and try everything they want, while you are  
afraid when they cry, are proud when they laugh, laugh when they hit the  
nurse or insult you, provide shade in the summer and heat in the winter, and  
many other luxuries. Poor children know none of these (luxuries) and are  
brought up more easily, grow up not the worse for it, and turn out much  
stronger.  
3. You, however, nurse your children like the progeny of Sardanapalus,  
weakening the nature of your sons through luxurious living. What can  
become of a child who cries if he does not eat soon enough; who, when he  
eats, seeks pleasure in fancy food; who is exhausted when it is hot, shakes  
and collapses when it is cold; who argues when someone criticizes him,  
suffers when someone doesn’t satisfy his whims, is annoyed whenever he is  
not chewing, wastes time on idle pleasures, and wanders around endlessly  
mumbling to himself?  
4. Therefore, my dear, knowing that spoiled children when they grow up  
to be men, become slaves (scil. to passion), be careful to take away such  
pleasures, by making their meals austere rather than luxurious, allowing  
them to endure hunger and thirst, and even cold, heat, and shame before  
their peers and superiors. For only in this way can they become noble in  
spirit whether they are praised or reprimanded. For hardships, my friend,  
are a sort of dye mordant to which children are exposed when their virtue is  
perfected, and those who have been dipped long enough wear the hue of  
virtue as something of their own. So, make sure, my dear, that because of  
(your) indulgence, your children do not acquire the vices of insolence and  
utter worthlessness, in the same way that poorly tended vines bear inferior  
fruit.  

[^19]: Literally: “they become pleasure-seeking in their souls, pleasure-loving in their bodies, and their souls become lazy and their bodies too weak.” -DD

### English


1. I have heard about your husband’s madness; he apparently keeps a hetaera   
and you are jealous of him. I have known, my dear, many men with this   
disease. It would seem that they are hunted down and captured by such   
women and lose their mind. You, however, despair night and day, and in   
your distress plot against him. Don’t do this, my dear! The virtue of a wife   
lies not in keeping a close watch on her husband’s affairs, but in being his   
companion. And companionship means tolerating his error. Your husband   
associates with the hetaera for pleasure, with his wife for what is beneficial   
(scil. for him). And it is beneficial not to join misery to misery and not to add   
madness to madness.  
2. Certain transgressions, my dear, when examined are made even worse,   
but when passed over in silence instead they come to an end, just as they say   
that fire dies out when undisturbed. If you expose him, when he wants you   
to appear not to have noticed, you will lift the veil of his disease and he will   
be openly doing wrong. You think that the love of your husband . . . is not up  
to the moral standard:[^11] for this (high standard) is expected of your rela-   
tionship. Consider then, that while he visits the hetaera for pleasure, he stays   
with you as your lifelong companion and that, while his love for you is   
rational, his love for her is driven by passion.   
3. And an affair of passion is short-lived; as soon as it peaks it becomes too   
much; it begins and ends quickly. A man who is not entirely evil will not be   
in love with a hetaera for long. For what is more fruitless than a desire   
enjoyed unfairly? Therefore, at some point he will realize that he is dimin-   
ishing his assets and offending decency. No one consciously continues to be   
self-destructive. Called back to you, then, by a sense of fairness towards you,   
seeing how his assets have diminished [for at some point he will take note of   
you], and unable to bear the contempt that comes with moral condemna-   
tion, he will soon change his mind.  
4. As for you, my dear, don’t spend your life responding to hetaerae but   
distinguish yourself by your tactful behavior towards your husband, by care  
for the household, friendly behavior towards your acquaintances, and tender   
love for your children. You should not compete with this woman (for it is   
commendable to extend good rivalry only towards those who are virtuous),   
but rather prepare yourself to make conciliatory gestures. Noble character   
incites good will even among enemies, my dear, and only upright standards   
can achieve respect, and, in this way, it is possible for a woman to surpass her   
husband’s authority and be respected instead of serving the enemy.[^12]   
5. If you tolerate his behavior, he will be more ashamed and will desire   
reconciliation sooner. He will love you even more tenderly when he recog-   
nizes his unfair treatment of you, realizes that you take care of his property,  
and has proof of your love for him. In the same way that the unpleasant   
sensations of the body render the moments of respite all the more pleasant,   
discord among friends leads to more intimate moments of reconciliation.  
6. You, however, must resist the prompts of passion. For it demands that   
you fall ill from sorrow because of your husband’s illness, that you disregard   
decency because of his disregard of morals, that you act against your best   
interests because he is ruining his life. If you yield,[^13] you will give the   
impression that you have joined him in battle, and by chastising him you   
also chastise yourself. If you break up with him and leave, you will test   
another husband, having left the first one, and, should he err in similar   
matters, again, another husband (for being single is unbearable for young   
women). Or perhaps you will remain alone without a husband, like a spinster.  
7. So, are you going to neglect your house and ruin your husband? If so, you   
shall choose a life of pain and suffering. You say that you are defending   
yourself against the hetaera? She will be careful to avoid you, and were she to defend   
herself, a woman who does not blush can put up a fight. So, is it good to quarrel   
with your husband every day? And what is gained? Quarrels and insults do not   
put an end to irresponsibility, but progressively increase discord. What else?   
Are you going to plot against him? Please don’t, my dear. The tragedy that   
contains the sequence of events in which Medea became a criminal has taught   
us to control jealousy. Just as when one’s eyes are sick, one has to keep one’s   
hands away from them, so you too avoid interfering with his illness. Through   
endurance you will put an end to his illness sooner.  


[^11]: Städele (1980: 312) ad loc. agrees with Hercher and Westermann that some words are missing after “ἡγῇ” contra Thesleff, who prints the text as is. Städele argues: “Doch gibt die Aussage: ‘Du aber glaubst, daß sich die Liebe deines Mannes nicht in sittlich einwandfreien Verhalten ausdrückt’ im Zusammenhang kein Sinn.” (But the utterance “but you think that your husband’s love does not express itself in a fashion suitable to noble behavior” makes no sense in this context.) Given the frequent references to the husband’s “illness” and “error” (e.g., lines 2–5, 9–12), the thought that the husband’s moral competence is lacking makes perfect sense, even if some words are missing.-DD 
[^12]: Städele (1980: 316–17) finds the ending of this sentence difficult to follow, as it is not explained who the enemy might be. Given the motif of the competition between Nicostrate and the hetaera, the latter is a very good candidate. -DD   
[^13]: Literary: “through these,” referring to the actions prompted by passion. -DD


## Theano to Callisto
## Note on Theano to Callisto

In this letter to Callisto, Theano instructs Callisto on how to manage household slaves. She recommends treating them fairly, being neither too strict nor too lenient. Interestingly, Theano advises the woman to seek advice from older married women. In Ancient Greece, women would commonly marry very young, sometimes as young as 14, and would immediately be thrust into responsibilities that they were ill-prepared to undertake. While a wife would often learn these duties from her husband, Theano posits that women must instead look to other women for this ethical education.

[^14]: This sentence exceptionally follows Thesleff ’s text (198: 15–16). Städele eliminates χάρις and prints γνώμη rather than συγγνώμη: Δεσποτικὴ δὲ καὶ ἡ γνώμη [χάρις] ἐφ’ ἡμαρτημένοις ζημίας ἀπαλλάττουσα· (It is within the owner’s discretion to cancel punishment for transgressions.) These two concepts also appear in ThN and seem integral to the system of ethics presented in Theano’s letters. -DD

1. The right to manage household slaves is given by custom to you younger women as soon as you are married. Nonetheless, instruction by older women, who are always offering advice in everything that concerns domestic affairs, is necessary. It is proper first to recognize what you don’t know and to consider the advice of older women most suitable. In these things a young mind must be educated from girlhood. The first domestic responsibility for women is the management of slave women, and the most important aspect in dealing with slaves is, my dear, their good will. For this is not something purchased as (our) property along with their bodies, but intelligent owners create it afterwards.
2. And it is obtained through such fair treatment that they are neither
exhausted by overwork nor lose strength because of deprivation. They are human beings by nature. Some women consider what is least profitable as a profit: the mistreatment of slave women, burdening them with chores while decreasing their rations. Securing petty profits in this way, they pay huge penalties: ill will and treachery of the worst kind. You, however, will have a convenient measure for the rations of food: in proportion to the amount of wool produced by a day’s work.
3. This is all you need to do about their diet. As for lack of discipline, 
you must see to what suits you, not what is convenient for them. You should value slave-women according to their merit. Cruelty will not instill gratitude in their minds, while rational treatment assures discipline no less efficiently. If, however, it is impossible to suppress the excess of their malice, one must drive it out by means of selling them. Let the estranged slave, become (formally) estranged from the owner. [^15] In this, let it be your chief concern that you establish first the fact of the offence, with the aim of giving a just verdict, second the magnitude of the offense, with the aim of giving an appropriate punishment.
4. It is worthy of a woman who is in control to forgive and cancel punishment for transgressions; in doing so she shall uphold decency in a way that is true to her character. Some women, my dear, out of savagery actually whip the bodies of the slave women, and turn into beasts through jealousy or anger, as though carving (scil. into the slaves’ bodies) their extreme bitterness. Some servants have been killed through being worn out over time, others have sought salva-tion through escape, yet others died, having ended their lives with their own hands. Then at last the solitude of the mistress who bewails her own lack of judgment finally brings a change of mind—too late.
5. But you, my dear, mindfully imitate (the art of tuning) string instru-
ments, which are out of tune when excessively loose and snap when strung too tight. The same holds true for the slave women: excessive leniency produces dissonance of discipline; severity inevitably destroys their lives. Finally, one needs to keep in mind that “measure is best in all things.” [Farewell.]




[^15]: Literally: “Let what is foreign to the need (of the house) be estranged from its mistress.” This process of estrangement is the opposite of oikeiōsis. -DD

οἰκοδεσπότης “the master of the house” and οἰκοδέσποινα “the mistress of
the house” I found both compound nouns in the letter that Theano the wife

The People of Tarentum.



# About this Source

The four letters included in this edition belong to a body of writings known as the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha, produced during the first and second centuries CE.[^1] Although these texts claim authorship by figures associated with the early Pythagorean community of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, none of them are genuinely archaic. Instead, they were created several centuries after Pythagoras lived, in a cultural moment when interest in the Pythagorean past was being revived. These letters are part of a larger effort by later authors to construct a coherent tradition that stretched back to Pythagoras and his followers, despite the absence of any authenticated writings from the historical founder himself.[^2]

Pythagoras is unusual among major philosophical figures as he left no written texts. His teachings were transmitted orally, and later generations encountered only indirect references to what he believed or taught. This absence created an intellectual vacuum. By the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Pythagoras had acquired an almost legendary reputation, and authors began to fill in the gaps by producing letters, treatises, and sayings attributed to him and those around him.[^3] These writings were not intended as outright forgeries in a modern sense. Rather, they functioned as imaginative reconstructions, attempts to give shape to a philosophical lineage that had become central to later thinkers.

The letters attributed to Theano fit exactly within this context. Theano appears in later biographical traditions as either the wife or student of Pythagoras, although there is no contemporary evidence for her existence.[^4] By the Roman period, she had become an idealized figure associated with the domestic and ethical dimension of Pythagoreanism. Attaching new writings to her name provided a way for authors to explore topics related to women’s conduct, household authority, and moral education while grounding those ideas in a supposedly ancient foundation. These texts therefore reveal as much about the period in which they were composed as about the past they claimed to represent.

The presence of women in the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha is striking, given the broader context of ancient Greek intellectual life. Classical Greek philosophy was overwhelmingly male, and women were generally excluded from institutions of learning and public discourse.[^5] Their lives were shaped by expectations of modesty, obedience, and domestic management. Yet the Neopythagorean corpus includes multiple female figures such as Theano, Damo, Myia, and Melissa, who appear as confident moral authorities. Their writings address household management, childrearing, and ethical behavior, all framed as philosophical duties. The content of the letters also reveals the way Neopythagorean writers conceived of philosophical authority. Rather than focusing on abstract metaphysics or mathematics, the letters explore how to live a proper life. They treat quotidian actions (speech, dress, childrearing, etc.) as morally significant, which reflects a broader Pythagorean interest in shaping the soul through disciplined habit.[^6] While these texts do not prove that women actively participated in philosophical circles, they do show that later authors imagined a Pythagorean tradition in which female instruction was plausible, even desirable.

This imagined past worked to legitimize contemporary social roles. Roman imperial culture valued household order as the foundation of civic stability, and the Pythagorean letters reflect this emphasis. Theano’s advice frequently links personal virtue to household management, implying that ethical behavior begins in the private sphere. By situating such claims in the voice of an ancient woman philosopher, the texts embed Roman ideals about domestic authority in a tradition represented as timeless.[^7] The strategy is effective: readers are encouraged to treat these moral directives as inherited wisdom rather than recent invention.

The pseudonymous format was crucial to this projection. By attributing their writings to figures like Theano, later authors created the illusion of continuity with the ancient past. Modern scholarship has shown that many of these letters were written by educated men during the Roman imperial period, not by women.[^8] However, their authors’ decision to write in the voices of women gives us insight into how gender was conceptualized within later philosophical contexts. Women in these texts are depicted as moral authorities within the household, and their authority derives from virtues such as moderation, self-control, and protectiveness over the family unit. The Pythagorean letters thus perform a cultural function: they offer models of behavior that align domestic hierarchy with philosophical legitimacy.

There is also a wider cultural reason for the choice of the letter form. Letters were a common vehicle for philosophical instruction during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Philosophers such as Epicurus and Seneca used letters to convey ethical teaching in a concise and personal way. The letter format allowed Pythagorean writers to present advice as though it were directed to real addressees, reinforcing the impression of authenticity. The practical tone of these letters contrasts with the more speculative style of other ancient philosophical genres, making them appear accessible and direct.[^9]

It is important to recognize that the inclusion of women in these texts does not necessarily reflect real opportunities for female philosophical agency. The letters depict women acting within boundaries that male authors considered appropriate. They are authoritative only insofar as they reinforce domestic order. The texts do not present women debating metaphysics or participating in politics. Rather, they situate women as stewards of household virtue, responsible for maintaining social stability. This limited scope suggests that although women could be imagined within the philosophical tradition, their imagined roles remained constrained by the assumptions of their time.

Nonetheless, the letters should not be dismissed as strictly reflecting tradition. They complicate our understanding of ancient intellectual history by showing that women were not entirely absent from philosophical narratives. Even if their voices were constructed, the fact that writers felt compelled to include them indicates a shift in how philosophical authority was conceived. The Pythagorean tradition, real or invented, provided a space in which women could appear as philosophical agents, however narrowly defined. The resulting texts offer a rare window onto ancient beliefs about gender, ethics, and authorship, and reveal how cultural memory can reshape the past to serve present needs.

# About this Edition

The four letters in this edition are Neopythagorean pseudepigrapha: later compositions presented as advice from Theano, a figure whom later sources describe as a Pythagorean philosopher associated with ethical and domestic instruction. Although the letters claim an earlier origin, they were written in the first or second century CE and reflect how later authors imagined Theano’s voice rather than preserving the words of a historical individual.

The Greek and English texts used here were provided by Professor Dorota Dutsch, whose translations we reproduce without alteration. Dutsch based her work on the standard modern editions of the Pythagorean letters, using William Thesleff’s The Pythagorean Texts of the Hellenistic Period (1965) and Adolf Städele’s The Letters of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans (1980). Both scholars relied on fragments preserved in a fifth-century CE anthology compiled by Johannes of Stobi, who assembled excerpts of philosophical writings for his son.[^10] 

In her own approach, Dutsch focuses on presenting the material in a format that reflects how these texts operated within the Pythagorean tradition rather than attempting to reconstruct an earlier version. She selects only the works attributed to women that she examines in her research and generally follows Thesleff for treatises and Städele for letters, retaining Städele’s section divisions and adding her own only when needed for clarity. Her aim is to preserve the character of the surviving texts while making their structure and purpose accessible to modern readers. All translations are her own. We have kept her footnotes, marking them with a "-DD" to distinguish them from ours.
